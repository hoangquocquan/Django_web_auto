# AI Sales current-state audit

Audit baseline: `main` at `c03d55506ef3ffd38e5e7bb290b981c1a3ccb17f` before work on `feature/ai-sales-assistant`.

## Existing files and services

- `django_backend/apps/ai_agent/services/sales_assistant.py` already provides `SalesAssistantService` with lead analysis, customer summaries, draft email generation, and weekly recommendations.
- `django_backend/apps/ai_agent/services/sales_facts.py` creates a minimized deterministic fact envelope for generation.
- `django_backend/apps/ai_agent/services/sales_synthesis.py` uses the existing Ollama abstraction, validates structured output, rejects autonomous-action claims, and falls back safely.
- `django_backend/apps/ai_agent/views.py` exposes the existing AI Sales controller and runs authentication, permission, and AI-governance checks.
- `django_backend/apps/knowledge/services/search_service.py` is the governed knowledge search used by AI Sales.
- `django_backend/apps/knowledge/services/synthetic_rag_demo.py` provides the isolated internal synthetic component corpus, grounded retrieval, generation-provider abstraction, citations, and explicit unsupported behavior.
- `django_backend/apps/knowledge/services/access_policy.py` controls document and chunk readability.
- `django_backend/apps/ai/services/governance_service.py` records correlation IDs, actors, policy decisions, hashes, and redacted metadata.

## Existing API endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/ai/sales-assistant/` supports `lead_analysis`, `customer_summary`, `email_draft`, and `weekly_recommendation` for users with `ai_sales:read`.
- `POST /api/v1/internal/rag-demo/query/` and `POST /api/v1/internal/rag-chat/` expose the authenticated synthetic technical RAG workflow.
- `POST /api/v1/public/ai-component-demo/` is a separately gated public surface and does not use sales context.

## Existing models

- Sales: `SalesLead`, `SalesOpportunity`, `SalesRfq`, `SalesRfqLine`, `SalesRfqDocument`, `SalesQuotation`, `SalesFollowUp`, and `SalesActivity`.
- Business: `BusinessCustomer`, `BusinessProduct`, and `BusinessMaterial`.
- Transaction domain: canonical orders and order progress/audit records.
- AI audit: `AIGovernanceEvent`, `AgentRun`, and `AgentToolAudit`.

A new Lead model is not justified. The existing sales and RFQ aggregates cover the MVP domain.

## Existing tests

- `tests/test_sales_crm_ai.py` covers authenticated AI Sales RAG use, drafts, and human approval.
- `tests/test_ai_sales_grounded_synthesis.py` covers source validation, deterministic scoring protection, provider failure, unsafe output rejection, and draft-only behavior.
- `tests/test_ai_enterprise_governance.py` and `tests/test_ai_governance_v2.py` cover governance policy and audit behavior.
- Knowledge tests cover internal/public isolation, access policy, synthetic retrieval, citations, and unsupported queries.

## Existing UI

- The Django business UI already has `/business/ai-sales/` with structured lead-analysis and draft cards.
- The React application has a `#/sales-ai` placeholder, but it is static and is not wired to the AI Sales API.
- The React admin area already has working authenticated internal RAG pages that can be reused as the UI integration pattern.

## Existing RAG integration

The legacy AI Sales service already calls `KnowledgeSearchService`; the synthetic component demo uses the same embeddings, vector store, governed knowledge records, RAG generation pipeline, and citation chain. Public access is independently scoped and gated.

## Missing pieces for this MVP

- No single structured contract with `SUPPORTED`, `NEEDS_MORE_INFORMATION`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.
- No RFQ-aware analysis endpoint under `/api/v1/internal/ai-sales/`.
- Existing lead output uses a numeric score/grade rather than the requested explainable `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, or `NEEDS_REVIEW` priority.
- No grounded component-match list, normalized missing-information list, or constrained next-action enum in one response.
- No React `#/admin-ai-sales` workspace connected to the internal API.
- No deterministic endpoint/security/public-isolation tests for the three required request cases.

## Reuse decisions

- Extend `SalesAssistantService`; do not create a parallel AI Sales subsystem.
- Reuse canonical `SalesRfq` and existing lead/opportunity/customer/product models; add no migration.
- Reuse the internal synthetic RAG service for the controlled MVP component corpus and its existing generation fallback.
- Reuse `FoundationPermissionService` and `AIGovernanceService` for authorization and traceability.
- Preserve the legacy endpoint and Django business UI to avoid breaking existing workflows.

## Code that should remain untouched

- Public AI enablement flags and public endpoint behavior.
- Quotation approval/send, order transitions, pricing, and customer-contact commands.
- Existing lead/opportunity/RFQ/quotation schemas.
- The current knowledge approval, indexing, and public-release governance rules.

## Continuation decisions — 2026-09-25

Repository inspection confirmed that there was no existing reusable tenant-level or customer-ACL service for `SalesRfq`. The safe minimal decision implemented for AI Sales is:

- Admin and Manager can list/analyze all RFQs.
- Sales can list/analyze only RFQs they created or that are assigned to them.
- Viewer, inactive, and unknown roles receive no RFQs.
- Missing and out-of-scope IDs share not-found semantics to avoid existence disclosure.
- The selector and analyzer use the same `RfqAccessService`; the controller does not duplicate object rules.

This is an explicit creator/assignee boundary, not a claim of tenant isolation. A future organization/customer ACL should replace or extend the service rather than add checks directly to individual views.

The production-knowledge audit also confirmed that the existing approved/versioned knowledge pipeline, embeddings, vector store, `KnowledgeSearchService`, and access policy are the only acceptable path to real catalog knowledge. `AI_SALES_KNOWLEDGE_SOURCE` therefore remains `governed_synthetic` by default and fails closed for any unimplemented source. No second RAG engine or ungoverned production data path was added.

Operational telemetry reuses the existing metrics registry with categorical allowlisted labels only. It intentionally excludes raw request text, customer identity, RFQ notes, email, source text, and credentials.
