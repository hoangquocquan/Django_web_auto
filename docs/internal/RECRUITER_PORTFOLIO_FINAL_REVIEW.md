# Recruiter Portfolio Final Review

## Repository

- Repository: <https://github.com/hoangquocquan/Django_web_auto>
- Local path: `C:\Users\hoang\Documents\ChatGPT\WEB Ô TÔ DJANGO`
- Branch: `chore/recruiter-ready-portfolio`
- Final portfolio content commit: `abc8769336b9b20b5aae47881ec2f48dc0af8091`
- PR URL: <https://github.com/hoangquocquan/Django_web_auto/pull/16>

The branch is based on the correct repository and is not `main`. No merge was performed.

## Final diff

The committed portfolio diff contains the English README, Japanese README, architecture documentation, screenshot instructions, recruiter reports, and root-document reorganization. The application code changes visible in the current worktree are pre-existing changes and were not included in the portfolio commit.

No new migration, `.env` file, credential, build artifact, cache, or personal document was added to the portfolio commit.

## Root

Root cleanliness is improved. Root Markdown is limited to `README.md`, `README_JA.md`, and `RECRUITER_PORTFOLIO_CLEANUP_REPORT.md`. Historical phase, audit, handoff, review, readiness, diagnostic, and planning documents remain available under `docs/internal/`.

## README EN

The English README explains the project, stack, business flow, RAG and AI Sales Assistant responsibilities, RFQ/CRM relationship, n8n/LINE integration, AWS staging/target wording, local entry points, security expectations, and AI-tool disclosure. It is intentionally concise and avoids production claims.

## README JA

The Japanese README is consistent with the English version and uses standard technical terms for a Japanese engineering/recruiter audience. It avoids exaggerated marketing language.

## Architecture

`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` contains Mermaid diagrams for the React → Django → PostgreSQL/RAG → AI Sales Assistant → LLM flow, RFQ → n8n → LINE workflow, and the AWS-oriented Internet → ALB → ECS → RDS design with S3, ECR, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, and GitHub Actions. AWS wording clearly identifies staging/target architecture rather than verified production deployment.

## Screenshots

- Product page: added
- AI Sales Chatbot: added
- RFQ workflow: added
- Admin operations: added

All screenshots were captured from the running local application with fictional demo/fixture data. Authenticated screenshots use a minimal header redaction to remove a hard-coded personal display name. No artificial screenshot was added.

## GitHub presentation

- About: updated to `AI-powered automotive parts sales platform built with Django, React, PostgreSQL, RAG, n8n and AWS.`
- Topics: updated with `django`, `react`, `postgresql`, `rag`, `ai`, `llm`, `n8n`, `aws`, `docker`, `rest-api`, `github-actions`, `automotive`, `portfolio`, `full-stack`, and `ai-assistant`.
- `gh auth status`: authenticated successfully as `hoangquocquan` using HTTPS Git operations.
- Pull request: <https://github.com/hoangquocquan/Django_web_auto/pull/16>.

## Validation

- Django system check: passed.
- Django migration check: passed; no changes detected.
- Focused/full Django tests: full suite attempted; 16 import errors remain from the pre-existing `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts'` issue in phase 10/11 tests. No unrelated test infrastructure was changed.
- Frontend tests: passed, 167 tests.
- Frontend production build: passed with Vite.
- README links: reviewed; referenced files exist.
- Mermaid diagrams: reviewed for standard `flowchart LR` syntax.
- Root path references: no non-document references to moved filenames found.
- CI: all PR checks passed for screenshot commit `abc8769336b9b20b5aae47881ec2f48dc0af8091`, including Django checks/tests, React production builds, PostgreSQL migration smoke tests, Phase 13.2 Test Pipeline, dependency/SBOM audit, filesystem vulnerability scan, full-history secret scan, Python SAST, and AWS learning-lab validation.

## Security

- No credential, token, API key, AWS credential, or LINE credential was added.
- Tracked environment files are examples only; no active `.env` file is part of the portfolio commit.
- Screenshot review found no secrets, credentials, real email addresses, phone numbers, AWS account IDs, LINE credentials, or real customer records.
- Secret-pattern review found only unfilled documentation placeholders such as `N8N_API_KEY=`.

## Pre-existing issues

- The worktree contains extensive uncommitted application changes unrelated to portfolio presentation.
- The full Django suite has the pre-existing `scripts` import issue described above.
- The local standalone full Django invocation still has the previously documented phase 10/11 `scripts` import-path issue, although the repository's GitHub Actions Django checks passed.
- The four requested portfolio screenshots have been captured from the local application and committed.

## Blockers

No technical blocker remains for this portfolio PR. Final owner review is still required before merge.

## Final recommendation

`READY TO MERGE`

The repository is suitable for PR review and merge after the owner reviews the diff and confirms the documented pre-existing local test issue. This review does not merge into `main`.
